# learnyouarobot
An interactive robotics programming lesson webapp. Supports multiple (RoboRIO) deploy targets, deploy queueing (users have to wait for other users to finish using the robot), premade lessons to start from, build and RIOLog output, and syntax highlighting and formatting (very similar to Visual Studio Code, because we embed monaco.)
